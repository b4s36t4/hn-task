People affected by this, like my grandfather, will usually require a feeding tube to allow enough calories without risking aspiration. However, even with this, we are constantly relying on our epligottis and swallowing reflexes to prevent microaspirations of saliva and oral bacteria. Because of this, people with ALS are at extremely high risk for pneumonia, which would be my first guess as being most likely. His was lucky in that his ALS was a subtype that didn&#x27;t progress as rapidly as most do.<p>I think you don&#x27;t deserve the downvoting you are getting even though the timing of your question is not great, you&#x27;re still trying to understand what the natural progression of ALS is.",

        "text": "Even if there is only one possible unified theory, it is just a set of rules and equations. What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe? The usual approach of science of constructing a mathematical model cannot answer the questions of why there should be a universe for the model to describe. Why does the universe go to all the bother of existing? Is the unified theory so compelling that it brings about its own existence? Or does it need a creator, and, if so, does he have any other effect on the universe? And who created him?<p>Up to now, most scientists have been too occupied with the development of new theories that describe what the universe is to ask the question why. On the other hand, the people whose business it is to ask why, the philosophers, have not been able to keep up with the advance of scientific theories. In the eighteenth century, philosophers considered the whole of human knowledge, including science, to be their field and discussed questions such as: did the universe have a beginning? However, in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, science became too technical and mathematical for the philosophers, or anyone else except a few specialists. Philosophers reduced the scope of their inquiries so much that Wittgenstein, the most famous philosopher of this century, said, “The sole remaining task for philosophy is the analysis of language.” What a comedown from the great tradition of philosophy from Aristotle to Kant!<p>However, if we do discover a complete theory, it should in time be understandable in broad principle by\neveryone, not just a few scientists. Then we shall all, philosophers, scientists, and just ordinary people, be able to take part in the discussion of the question of why it is that we and the universe exist. If we find the answer to that, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason – for then we would know the mind of God.<p>-- Stephen Hawking",

I doubt it. The metaphysics are really complex here. A better attempt (if any can be made) is that the &#x27;self&#x27; is both an evolving bodily mass AND an evolving sense of memories and perceptions. Ultimately there&#x27;s good rational that self&#x2F;me is just a non-real tool that allows you to operate in the world. You can not &#x27;not believe&#x27; in self as you&#x27;re human brain requires it, and animals do just fine without thinking of self (driven by nature). A better strategy is to minimize the view of self in order to reduce confusions caused by &#x27;staring too intently in the mirror&#x27;, but yet it&#x27;s also useful to evaluate oneself as a separate actor.<p>Also I think you can have Consciousness without having a notion of defined self though, like a collective consciousness or a dolphin&#x2F;octopus&#x2F;crow form of awareness.<p>I&#x27;d recommend this lecture from Shelly Kagan.\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=p2J7wSuFRl8&amp;list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=p2J7wSuFRl8&amp;list=PLEA18FAF1A...</a>",

There may not be an atom in my entire body that is original to my body; and there are vastly more atoms in my body now than then. When I say &quot;me&quot; I don&#x27;t really mean my body or even my brain, even if that&#x27;s where &quot;me&quot; is. We are really talking about our consciousness.<p>It&#x27;s been awhile since I read it, but ... In <i>The Zen of Physics</i>, David J. Darling argues that if some other collection of atoms has a consciousness like our own, that is no different than ourselves. (His idea of consciousness is something like patterns in the brain, which is distinct, if reliant, from a collection of atoms.) We would have no memory of our past experiences, but in a real sense we would be alive again. His arguments are a bit more elegant than I have presented here. And there is some question to whether an identical consciousness with different memories is really <i>you</i> or <i>me</i>, but it would mean that waiting for trillions of years isn&#x27;t necessarily the case.<p>This, of course, assumes that consciousness is an emergent phenomena. It is possible that consciousness is not emergent from brain processes, but is a fundamental property of the universe that the brain has somehow harnessed because it is an evolutionary advantage. (<i>Physics of Consciousness: The Quantum Mind and the Meaning of Life</i> by Evan Harris Walker is a fun read on this idea.) In which case, in some form you would exist as long as the universe exists, and always have.<p>As an aside, for those without consciousness (<i>i.e.</i> the dead and the unborn) time does not exist, so both &quot;to wait&quot; and &quot;forever&quot; are impossible. :)",

They are largely based on the length of time needed to procreate and ensure a successful subsequent generation or two; and on our ability to overcome that limitation. Saying, &quot;I would not take immortality treatments if they were available&quot; is different from &quot;I will not accept medical help for my heart condition&quot; only by a matter of scale. Having more humans on the planet and for longer does come with challenges, including resource usage issues, but it also comes with the tools to conquer those challenges and other benefits besides.<p>The cost of mortality is having Albert Einstein around for a meager 76 years, instead of hundreds or thousands. Multiplied by all the other great minds our species has produced, this is an incredible cost that, in my opinion, vastly outweighs your assumptions about the cost of immortality.<p>In my opinion, culture can only be threatened by homogeneity, but even print, radio, television, film, and internet haven&#x27;t managed to kill it. Immortality will necessitate and possibly facilitate cultural change. First, because our culture will have to adapt to accepting immortality. Second, because immortal beings will likely become bored. We really have no indication that culture will stagnate or die. I suspect it will slow, but I suspect most things will slow when we are no longer so bound by time. And, due to resource issues, immortality will likely require (and possibly result in) a great diaspora of humanity. More humans, living in more places, having more experiences, and being more separated, means a more diverse culture, even if a lot of those humans are the same humans.<p>Finally, immortal humans will likely be far better caretakers of resources. They will have personal incentives to make sure there are enough resources, that those resources are renewed, and that they are used in a way that preserves the planet. Humans have a very difficult time even conceptualizing what the world may be like for their great-great-grandchildren (and modifying their behavior accordingly), but they understand fear for their personal safety far better.",

It  surveys much of scientific knowledge roughly narrated as a history of scientific discovery and the development of science.<p>&#x27;Elegant universe&#x27; is a little denser. It&#x27;s about as accessible as string theory gets, and that&#x27;s surprisingly accessible. It also surveys a lot of scientific knowledge. For example, it has a very  intuitive explanation of how knowing about the constant speed of light (Einstein) makes time travel possible. Also, it explains open questions that string theory is trying to solve, which are the big, TOE questions in physics currently.<p>Hard to beat Hawkins though. He heavily influenced and inspired these guys, an proved that hard science is interesting for everyone. Goodbye Professor. You will be missed.",

Good suggestions though.<p>What stands out that I could read in the 1980s? I mentioned George Gamow&#x27;s little book: One Two Three . . . Infinity: Facts and Speculations of Science.<p>Many Carl Sagan books were available by then. Ask Google.<p>Isaac Asimov wrote about everything, but his monthly essays in the Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction (magazine) often covered some physics topic. I love how he tells the story: Always about the person, the time, the ideas, the meanings of the words, good analogies. He made it all seem so simple, but I know now that he was a master and loved it (and bragged about it too). Those essays were often collected into paperback collections, and my high school library got them.<p>Asimov also wrote a History of Physics book. Really thick and long. I read it for a book report for English class, because I was a total nerd and it seemed like a fun project. Most others read a comic book because those passed as &quot;non-fiction&quot; (for real).<p>One of the better textbooks is Introduction to Electrodynamics by David J. Griffiths. That one stands out in my mind.",

There was no Amazon.<p>I got <i>A Brief History of Time</i> and read it, and it&#x27;s almost cliche to say so, but it changed the course of my life. It&#x27;s not the only book that affected me, but it was pivotal. George Gamow&#x27;s little book also was available, and some good Asimov stuff, but otherwise nothing really.<p>So I went to university in the big city (Saskatoon!) and studied physics, and they had a whole <i>library</i> of physics books! You&#x27;d think it was like heaven, but a lot of those books were crap or hard to read. Hawking showed how one can aim for a book that&#x27;s interesting-and-good and actually achieve it. A few others managed to do the same. There are probably 20 actually-good and readable physics books in the whole world, and his books are a few of them.",

(As a physics PhD;  and I don&#x27;t blame Hawking for this,  rather the rest of the environment.)<p>Circa 1970 the number of physics PhD&#x27;s produced has outstripped the number of permanent jobs in physics,  sometimes by a factor of 30:1!<p>One result of that is that physicists have to make it through a keyhole to get established.  Another change that has happened since then has been a profound disconnect between theory and experiment.  Back in the day,  Einstein could make a prediction about light being bent by the Sun and have it be confirmed in his own lifetime.<p>The &quot;modern&quot; physics superstar like Hawking or Witten just doesn&#x27;t do that.  When neutron oscillations were finally detected after years,  it is almost forgotten who to give credit for for the theory because it is really just a conjecture that some matrix element isn&#x27;t zero.  Even in condensed matter there is the spectacle of seeing theoreticians dogpile on the problem of cuprate oxide superconductivity for 20 years without making any progress until an experimentalist noted stripes in the electron density.<p>The result of it is that you get ahead by getting the approval of much older physicists,  not by understanding the world.<p>As for Hawking himself,  his ideas about information loss in black holes,  the wavefunction not being unitary and all that were just plain bad ideas that held back quantum gravity by 30 years or so.",
